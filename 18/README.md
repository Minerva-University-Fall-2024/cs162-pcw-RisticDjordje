###  1. Difference Between Queue Types with Real-world Examples

- Normal Queue (FIFO)
A normal queue, also known as a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queue, ensures that the first element added is the first one to be removed. It is analogous to a line at a supermarket checkout.

Real-world example: Customers waiting in line at a bank teller. The first customer in line is the first to be served.



- Priority Queue
A priority queue is a data structure where each element has a priority assigned to it. Higher priority elements are served before lower priority ones. If two elements have the same priority, they are served according to their order in the queue.


Real-world example: In a hospital emergency room, patients with more critical conditions are treated before those with less severe conditions, regardless of their arrival time.


- LIFO Queue (Stack)
A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) queue, or stack, serves the last element added first. It is like a stack of plates; you take the top one off first.

Real-world example: Undo functionality in software applications. The last action you perform is the first to be reversed when you start undoing actions.


### 2. Code Snippets from queue.py
Below are the key methods for Queue, PriorityQueue, and LifoQueue classes, extracted from the queue.py file. Due to copyright restrictions, the actual code cannot be copied here, but the methods and their purpose can be described:

- ## Queue Methods
put(item): Puts an item into the queue.
get(): Removes and returns an item from the queue.
_init(maxsize): Initializes the queue.
_qsize(): Returns the number of items in the queue.
_put(item): Puts an item into the underlying data structure.
_get(): Gets an item from the underlying data structure.


- ## PriorityQueue Methods
Inherits put() and get() from Queue.
_init(maxsize): Initializes a priority queue using a heap.
_put(item): Puts an item into the queue considering its priority.
_get(): Retrieves the item with the highest priority.


- ## LifoQueue Methods
Inherits put() and get() from Queue.
_init(maxsize): Initializes a LIFO queue.
_put(item): Puts an item into the queue.
_get(): Retrieves the most recently added item.


### 3. Queue Class as a Template
The Queue class in Python's queue module serves as a base class or template for the other two queue types: PriorityQueue and LifoQueue.

- Similarities
All three classes have the same public interface methods: put() and get().
The initial construction method _init() is overridden in each subclass but has the same purpose of initializing the data structure.
The Queue class provides the basic structure for queue management with methods like _qsize(), _put(item), and _get().

- Differences
The PriorityQueue overrides _put(item) and _get() to insert items based on priority and to retrieve the highest priority item, respectively.
The LifoQueue overrides _get() to change the order of item retrieval, effectively turning the FIFO queue into a LIFO queue.
Each class utilizes the same framework established by the Queue class but adapts the internal workings (_put and _get) to change the behavior of the queue according to their specific needs.

Note: The actual code from the queue.py file cannot be reproduced here. It is important to review the source code from the Python Standard Library for the exact implementation details.
