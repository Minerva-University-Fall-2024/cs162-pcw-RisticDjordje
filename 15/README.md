Both the functional and object-oriented paradigms required minimal code changes for our task. In the functional approach, we simply incorporated a custom shuffle function to pick the desired PRNG algorithm. To add another PRNG option, one would just add an additional elif statement.

In the object-oriented approach, we introduced a 'prng' attribute to the Deck class and adjusted the shuffle method to align with the chosen PRNG algorithm specified by the 'prng' attribute. To expand it with another PRNG method, one could simply insert an elif statement in the initialization method to assign the appropriate PRNG algorithm to the 'prng' attribute.

Both paradigms are fairly similar in terms of extensibility. However, the functional style is more succinct and offers better readability.

In a massive codebase spanning millions of lines, the OOP style might pose maintenance challenges because of the necessity to monitor the state of each object. When altering an object's method or attribute, it's crucial to ensure that other dependent methods remain unaffected. Whereas, in a functional approach, there's no need to manage individual object states. The focus is merely on ensuring that a modified function doesn't adversely affect other reliant functions.

For scenarios like running multiple PRNG algorithms concurrently, the functional style proves more efficient as there's no object state management involved. One can seamlessly run the functions simultaneously and amalgamate the outcomes. Conversely, in the OOP method, managing and ensuring the consistency of each object's state becomes more complex, making the implementation and maintenance more challenging.
